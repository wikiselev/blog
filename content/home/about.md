# About
<br>
I am leading the [Cellular Genetics Informatics team](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/cellular-genetics-informatics) at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. Our team provides efficient access to cutting-edge analysis methods, environments and pipelines for Cellular Genetics programme, which leads a number of world-class research initiatives including the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/), [Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Initiative](http://www.hipsci.org) and [Human BioMolecular Atlas Program](Human BioMolecular Atlas Program). We work with large amounts of single-cell RNA sequencing and microscopy imaging data.
