# About
<br>
I am the head of [Cellular Genetics Informatics team](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/cellular-genetics-informatics) at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. My team provides efficient access to cutting-edge analysis methods for Cellular Genetics department, which leads a number of world-class research initiatives including the [Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Initiative](http://www.hipsci.org) (HIPSCI) and [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) (HCA). Our team's focus is the development and operation of workflows, tools and infrastructure for data analysis that support the departmentâ€™s research goals.
