I am going to take the following online course which starts at the end of October:

[https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics](https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics)

If you are interested and would like to join, please let me know, I think it would be more productive if we share our experiences!

In addition I would also highly recommend this educational resource:

[www.rosalind.info](www.rosalind.info)

It is made by the same people who organised the course and is a very good complementary exercise. I am involved in it and am solving the problems presented there. I think it is very useful!
