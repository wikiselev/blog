title: "SC3 - consensus clustering of single cell RNA Seq data"
---

Today I presented the [SC3 tool](http://github.com/hemberg-lab/SC3) that I am developing for clustering of single-cell RNA-Seq data. I think the audience liked my presentation, I received several very positive feedbacks and very interesting questions. One of the positive replies was from the [__edgeR__](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) developer [Davis McCarthy](https://sites.google.com/site/davismcc/). Now I feel honoured :-) Here are my slides if you are interested in single-cell research:

Enjoy!
