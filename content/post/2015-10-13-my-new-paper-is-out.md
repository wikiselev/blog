My paper "Perturbations of PIP3 signalling trigger a global remodelling of mRNA landscape and reveal a transcriptional feedback loop" has been published in Nucleic Acids Research journal! Here is a [link](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/10/11/nar.gkv1015.full) to it. It has been long 4 years since I started that project and I am very happy that finally it is published!

Special thanks to Veronique Juvin who performed all experiments for the paper and also thanks to all co-authors for their help, supervision and support!
