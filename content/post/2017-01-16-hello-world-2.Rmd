I haven't written anything to this blog during 2016. So one of my New Year's resolutions will be to start recording my work updates and personal thoughts here. I have also updated this blog to [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), so now I will be able to easily share my R wisdom with you. Here is what I will be able to plot and deploy in the blink of an eye!

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
#Create data
name=c(3,10,10,3,6,7,8,3,6,1,2,2,6,10,2,3,3,10,4,5,9,10)
feature=paste("feature ", c(1,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5) , sep="")
dat <- data.frame(name,feature)
dat <- with(dat, table(name, feature))
 
# Charge the circlize library
library(circlize)
 
# Make the circular plot
chordDiagram(as.data.frame(dat), transparency = 0.5)
```
