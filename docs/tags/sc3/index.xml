      <description>I am attending the Functional Genomics &amp;amp; Systems Biology: From Model Organisms to Human Health.
Here is my poster on SC3 clustering tool for single-cell RNA-Seq data:

      <description>Today I presented the SC3 tool that I am developing for clustering of single-cell RNA-Seq data. I think the audience liked my presentation, I received several very positive feedbacks and very interesting questions. One of the positive replies was from the edgeR developer Davis McCarthy. Now I feel honoured :-) Here are my slides if you are interested in single-cell research:
 Enjoy!</description>
