      <description>Today I received one of the best recent Bioinformatics books - Bioinformatics Algorithms by Phillip Compeau &amp;amp; Pavel Pevzner! Whether you are a specialist or a beginner this is a must read for you. The first time I found this course was in 2013 when I needed and wanted to learn the basics of Bioinformatics. It was a simple Coursera course that was just launched. In only a couple of years it has become a comprehensive course with several specializations.</description>

      <description>While doing Bioinformatics algorithms online course together with Stepic online educational resource I’ve met some interesting biological questions and answers to them. I’ve created a GitHub repository where I will store my scripts and descriptions of these questions:
https://github.com/wikiselev/bioinformatics-algorithms
I hope this will be useful for your everyday work.
List of all scripts and explanation to them can be found at the repository’s wiki. Please find all the descriptions there. Note that here I don’t provide any solutions to the course scored assignments.</description>

      <description>I am going to take the following online course which starts at the end of October:
https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics
If you are interested and would like to join, please let me know, I think it would be more productive if we share our experiences!
In addition I would also highly recommend this educational resource:
www.rosalind.info
It is made by the same people who organised the course and is a very good complementary exercise.</description>
