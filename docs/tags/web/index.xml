      <description>I have just updated this website with an academic theme and it looks amazing! I&amp;rsquo;m glad I&amp;rsquo;ve tried it. Now I not only have a solid functionality behind the website but also quite a pretty website&amp;rsquo;s face. I am convinced that Hugo is great and very fast for building websites. Please do not hesitate to try it out!</description>

      <description>I haven’t written anything to this blog during 2016. So one of my New Year’s resolutions will be to start recording my work updates and personal thoughts here. I have also updated this blog to blogdown, so now I will be able to easily share my R wisdom with you. Here is what I will be able to plot and deploy in the blink of an eye!
