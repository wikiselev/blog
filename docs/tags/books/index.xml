      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I received one of the best recent Bioinformatics books - Bioinformatics Algorithms by Phillip Compeau &amp;amp; Pavel Pevzner! Whether you are a specialist or a beginner this is a must read for you. The first time I found this course was in 2013 when I needed and wanted to learn the basics of Bioinformatics. It was a simple Coursera course that was just launched. In only a couple of years it has become a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;comprehensive course&lt;/a&gt; with several specializations. These two books are basically a summary of those Coursera specializations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition I would also highly recommend this educational resource: &lt;a href=&#34;www.rosalind.info&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;www.rosalind.info&lt;/a&gt;. It was made by the same people and contains a whole bunch of bioinformatics exercises. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun, please have a look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all for now, I am off to read some really cool stuff, hope you can share my excitement!&lt;/p&gt;
