      <description>Today I received one of the best recent Bioinformatics books - Bioinformatics Algorithms by Phillip Compeau &amp;amp; Pavel Pevzner! Whether you are a specialist or a beginner this is a must read for you. The first time I found this course was in 2013 when I needed and wanted to learn the basics of Bioinformatics. It was a simple Coursera course that was just launched. In only a couple of years it has become a comprehensive course with several specializations.</description>
